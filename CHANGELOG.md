# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `wyrm send --text` and `wyrm receive`: text messages to and from any
  magic-wormhole client, over the public mailbox or `--relay-url`.
- `wyrm send FILE`: one file to any magic-wormhole client over a direct
  connection. `wyrm receive` asks before accepting, or takes `--accept-file`,
  and `-o` picks where the file goes. It never overwrites an existing file.
