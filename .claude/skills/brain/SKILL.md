description: Use and maintain the brain/ knowledge base - the committed docs describing how wyrmyon works (architecture, features, decisions, glossary). Invoke when the user asks how/where something works ("how is the transport chosen", "which servers does it use", "how is the iroh connection authenticated"), when onboarding, or when asked to update, audit, or fix the brain after a change. Read brain/BRAIN.md first; navigate via the indexes, not a whole-tree grep.

# The brain

`brain/` is the committed knowledge base: how wyrmyon works, written so you can
answer without reading the source. Use it as the first stop for understanding,
and keep it true to the code.

## Navigating (to answer a question)

1. Open `brain/BRAIN.md` - the entry index. It has a topic table and a **Find by
   question** table.
2. Drill via the sub-indexes: `brain/architecture/index.md` (the how) and
   `brain/features/index.md` (the what). Don't grep the whole tree; the indexes
   are the routing layer.
3. Land on the leaf doc. It is self-contained and ends with a `## Sources` list
   of the real code paths - follow those only if the doc isn't enough or you
   suspect drift.
4. Terms -> `brain/glossary.md`. Rationale / "why" -> `brain/decisions.md`.

A doc whose title says **(Planned)** describes the agreed design, not code.
Say so when you answer from it.

Structure:

```
brain/BRAIN.md                 root index + find-by-question
brain/glossary.md  decisions.md
brain/architecture/index.md    overview wormhole-core transit-classic negotiation servers iroh-v1 distribution testing
brain/features/index.md        one doc per user-facing feature
```

## Maintaining (after a change)

The rule is in `CLAUDE.md` ("The brain"). The code is the source of truth - if a
doc disagrees with reality, fix the doc.

- A change that makes a brain doc wrong fixes that doc on the **same branch**.
- A milestone that builds a **Planned** part: drop "(Planned)" from the title,
  describe what the code does (including where it departs from the design, and
  why, in `decisions.md`), and fill `## Sources`.
- New command or user-facing behaviour -> add or update `brain/features/<name>.md`,
  then its row in `brain/features/index.md` and the Features table in
  `brain/BRAIN.md` (and a Find-by-question row if it answers a new question).
- Mailbox, PAKE or version message changed -> `brain/architecture/negotiation.md`
  and `servers.md`.
- Any wire identifier changed (`app_versions` key, `iroh-v1`, ALPN, HKDF
  labels) -> `brain/architecture/iroh-v1.md`, the list in `CLAUDE.md`, and a
  `decisions.md` entry saying how older peers are handled.
- Release, packaging or CI changed -> `brain/architecture/distribution.md`.
- New non-obvious decision -> append it to `brain/decisions.md` with its "why".
  New term -> `brain/glossary.md`.
- Style: dense, skimmable, present tense, normal prose. No em-dashes.
  Cross-link siblings with relative markdown links. Cite source paths instead
  of restating code. End each doc with `## Sources`.

Before committing, check every relative link in the touched docs resolves:

```bash
python3 - <<'EOF'
import glob, os, re
for f in glob.glob("brain/**/*.md", recursive=True):
    for m in re.finditer(r"\]\(([^)#]+)", open(f).read()):
        t = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(f), m.group(1)))
        if not m.group(1).startswith("http") and not os.path.exists(t):
            print("broken:", f, m.group(1))
EOF
```

## Auditing (drift check on request)

When asked to verify the brain matches reality:

1. Scope it to the relevant leaf doc(s) - don't re-audit everything.
2. For each, read the `## Sources` paths and confirm the doc's claims still hold
   (crate layout, wire identifiers, command flags and defaults, server URLs).
   The quickest cross-checks: `cargo run -q --bin wyrm -- --help` and each
   subcommand's `--help`, and `grep -rn 'const ' crates/*/src`.
3. Where they diverge, the code wins: correct the doc. Note what you changed.
4. If a feature shipped or was removed, update the indexes (`BRAIN.md`, the two
   `index.md`) too so navigation stays accurate.

For a broad audit, fan out read-only agents (one per architecture or feature
doc) that each diff their doc against its `## Sources`, then apply the fixes.
